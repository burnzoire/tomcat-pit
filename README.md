## arduino
Contains the `.ino` file required compile and upload to the appropriate arduino. See the [panels section](panels.md) for more information.

## dxf
These are for laser cutting and engraving. They will usually contain no layer info so you will need to configure that yourself in the laser program of your choosing. It should be fairly obvious which lines are to be cut vs engraved (with fill). I may introduce a guide for this at some point based on k40 settings.

## stl
Some panels will require parts to be 3D printed, such as knobs and dials. Import into your preferred slicer. YMMV.

## Acknowledgements
The approach I've taken with these panels was heavily inspired by the great work at [The Warthog Project](https://thewarthogproject.com/).
